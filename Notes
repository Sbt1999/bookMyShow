Before rest, SOAP was in use and it used to send data in XML format

for ex -> client asked give me info for Student 1

so response will be:
@Controller
<Student>
    <name>Archana Nanaware </name>
    <ID> 1 </ID>
    <Roll> 23 </Roll>
</Student>

In older format

Now in @Rest phase all the response is in JSON format

JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation
{
    "name" : Shobhit
    "id" : 2
    "roll" : 25
}

@PathVariable --> we add when We need to look for path
for ex --> we need to get by id so we will write @PathVariable so we get to know from where id is coming
@PathVariable("userId") specifies that the userId path variable should be injected into the id method
parameter.


@Requestbody
in json format


Synchronization ->
DB - Isolation  Levels

Read Uncommitted -> No locking, all open to read .... fastest .... high chances of inconsistency
Read Commited -> we can only read commited data ... read uncommited > speed > repeatable read.....lesser inconsistency
Repeatable Read --> new copy of data is used until the entire completes.
Serializable -> no parallel transaction, transactions on a particular row can only happen sequentially

Serializable --> performance --> worst, consistency --> best.
